"MTA All Agency Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessment (TVRA) "," The TVRA is an evaluative process that:  aligns and prioritizes the MTA's 4,000 unit infrastructure asset base; identifies system threats pinpointed in the formulation of a threat secenario report (TSR); and through a cost benefit analysis develops operational and capital security measures that are designed to reduce the MTA's  risk/consequence of manmade events . The initial Tier 0 TVRA segment evaluates the effects of the most plausible attack in the capital asset's  unmitigated or base level  state. Consequence is evaluated in three quantifiable elements: Cost of asset replacement/repair; cost of delay to the commuter; and cost of the loss of the wage earner, CAR + COD+CWE  =$$$$ The process is carried forward to the Tier I segment evaluating the asset in its mitigated state and then finalizes the assessment in the Tier II stage measuring the criticality , vulnerability and potential effects of system threats and then identifies security measures to thwart and limit the nefarious actions of our adversaries.

The Sustainability Policy complements other existing agency efforts, including the Clean Air Strategy to reduce CAP emissions.  The Port Authority seeks to decrease emissions by promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy options, instituting advanced technology, reducing waste and water use, and developing sustainable design and construction guidelines. In our Sustainability policy, the Port Authority committed to reduce GHG emissions from agency, tenant, and customer operations by 80 percent by 2050, using 2006 as the baseline. To help meet this voluntary commitment, the Port Authority completes and publishes annual GHG and CAP inventories, the first of which was completed in 2006, to assess whether GHGs and CAP emissions are decreasing Port Authority-wide. The 2006 Inventory Report was instrumental in identifying the initial inventory boundary for Port Authority operations, as well as those for key tenants and customers. The Port Authority has commissioned a GHG and CAP study each year since and most recently released the 2014 inventory.

In 2011, PANYNJ expanded the Sustainable Design Guidelines by creating Sustainable Infrastructure Guidelines (SIG) (referred to as “Part 2”) to complement the Sustainable Building Guidelines (SBG) (“Part1”). Together, the Sustainable Design Guidelines Parts 1 and 2 provide clear direction to optimize project sustainability through integrated design practice, with the complementary goals of enhancing cost effectiveness, extending the project lifespan and, in some cases, reducing operational and/or maintenance costs.

The plan also assigns roles and responsibiliites, response procedures, administrative duties, training, weather monitoring, and business recovery. The primary goals of the plan are to protect critical infrastructure and personnel, increase flood resiliency for the PANYNJ and stakeholders, and sustain and recover business operations. The World Trade Center Department continuously reviews mitigation vulnerabiliites for improvement to minimize risk to the multi-layer defensive system that includes a Bollard Protection System (BPS), Hesco Barriers, Aque Fence, and sub-grade pumps, and collection reseviors. Lastly, the plan is precipitaed by the 24/7/365 monitoring and reporting of inclement weather conditions by the WTC Operations Command Center (OCC) to the SSOPP team.

Ports Department,"The Port Department, in an effort to reduce the risk of impact of climate change and sea level rise have been proactively studying, assessing, and addressing the impacts that climate change has had and is projected to have on the PA's maritime facilities. These initiatives have been focused both by taking steps to provide better protection of our infrastructure against these challenges, and to address the operational response to these incidents. Addressing these challenges have been a corner stone of the departments efforts to rebuild portions of the Port following Superstorm Sandy. Partnerships with SMRO to secure Federal funding for these efforts have been paramount, while partnering with Engineering, OEM, OEEP, Operations staff, Planning Staff, and outside partners have been key to ensuring that the data and information we are using is the most up to date.
