Drainage System Maintenance,"At most times, a drainage system will do its job and move water to intended areas. However, if a system is not maintained erosion, material dumping, or deterioration of man-made reinforcement materials may reduce the carrying capacity of a stream. Therefore, regular maintenance, such as sediment and debris clearance, is needed so that the stream may carry out its design function.

Roads,"Roads are needed to get people and goods from place to place. In addition to planning for traffic control during floods, there are various construction and placement factors to consider when building roads. To maintain dry access, roads should be elevated above the base flood elevation. However, if a road creates a barrier it can cause water to pond. Where ponding is problematic, drainage and flow may be addressed by making changes to culvert size and placement. In situations where flood waters tend to wash roads out, construction, reconstruction, or repair can include not only attention to drainage but also stabilization or armoring of vulnerable shoulders or embankments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,riverine,X,X,,X,x,,,,,,,,x,,,,x,x,,,5.3 | 5.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,measure,,,X
Structural Flood Control Measures,"Structural flood control measures (e.g., levees, dams, or floodwalls) channel water away from people and property. Structural measures may also increase drainage or absorption capacities (e.g., detention and retention basins, relief drains, spillways, drain widening/dredging or rerouting, logjam and debris removal, extra culverts, bridge modification, dike setbacks, flood gates and pumps, or channel redirection). However, structural measures may cause an increase in the base flood elevation. History has shown that structures that channel water may create a false sense of security and result in greater damage to nearby properties if the structures fail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,riverine,X,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,,,x,x,,,5.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,measure,,,
Minor Structural Projects,"A minor structural project is similar but smaller and more localized than a structural project, in that the measures used to reduce flooding may include levees, floodwalls, dams or other activities that channel water away from people or property. However, a minor structural project should only be constructed in areas that cannot be mitigated through non- structural activities, or where structural activities are not feasible due to low densities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,riverine,x,,,,x,,,x,,,,,x,,,,x,x,,,5.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,measure,,,x
Dam and Levee Maintenance,"Although dams and levees may have been constructed properly, failure to maintain them can lead to significant loss of life and property if they are stressed and broken or breached during a flood event. An inspection, maintenance and enforcement program helps to ensure continued structural integrity. Dams or levees need to be kept in good repair. Unnecessary or old and structurally unsound dams should be removed. Planning for dam breaks can include constructing emergency access roads as well as automating pump and flood gate operation. Regulating development in a dam’s hydraulic shadow, where flooding would occur if there were a severe dam failure, is also important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,riverine,,x,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,x,x,,,1.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,measure,,,

Hazardous and Buoyant Material Protection,"Containers of hazardous materials such as petroleum or chemicals should not be located in a flood hazard area. If such a location is necessary, hazardous material containers need to be anchored, because the contents can contaminate water and multiply the damaging effects of flooding by causing fires or explosions, or by otherwise making structures unusable. Also, buoyant materials should be anchored, because if they float downstream, they may cause additional damage to buildings or bridges or may plug a stream resulting in higher flood heights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,riverine,,x,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,measure,,,

Flood Warning,"In addition to a communication strategy, a flood warning system may consist of people or machines monitoring water level with stream gauges. Although a flood warning system generally does not provide long-term damage reduction, it can alleviate health and safety risk by providing citizens time to escape and possibly remove belongings that could be damaged.
